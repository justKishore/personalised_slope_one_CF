Overview
This project implements a personalized recommendation system using the Weighted Slope One algorithm with the introduction of user similarity.
This combination of techniques enhances the accuracy and relevance of recommendations for users by taking into account their similarities to other users.

Data:
Movie lens 100k data is been used for this project. Download from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajitdatta/movielens-100k-dataset

Slope One:
The Slope One recommendation system is based on the idea that users who rate items similarly in the past are likely to have similar preferences. To enhance this basic idea, we introduce user similarity into the algorithm. Find more details on "Slope One Predictors for Online Rating-Based Collaborative Filtering.pdf"

Instructions:

1. ml-100k dataset folder should be in same location as the Jupyter Notebook file

2. To run the code, Open the main.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
   Go to Kernel, select Restart and Run All.

3. Expected runtime: 8 to 10mins

4. MAE and RMSE value is printed in last cell for evaluation

Contributing:
This is not perfect (you can see, the evaluation scores are not great), I'd love if someone helps me in improving the implementation.
If you'd like to contribute to this project, please contact me. I welcome contributions, bug reports, and feature requests.

Note: This is part of my coursework, and similar file submitted to the UNI, so proper citation required for usage.
Note: This is final single commit push, I didn't create repo while developing.
